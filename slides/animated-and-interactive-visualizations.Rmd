## Animated Visualizations

Offers an extra aesthetic that we can map variables to

Very useful for **presentations** and **webpages**!

Animating works best when mapping to time (or similar process).

### gganimate

.pull-left-60[
[gganimate](https://gganimate.com/) is a ggplot-based solution for producing
animations in R.

You may need to download and install a **renderer**; I recommend
[gifski](https://gif.ski/).
]

.pull-right-40[
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gganimate.svg")
```

### Example: Housing Sales in Texas

Start with some data.

```{r}
# aggregate over years
tx <- select(txhousing, city, year, sales:inventory) |>
  group_by(city, year) |>
  summarize_all(mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

.pull-left[
Then build a basic ggplot.

```{r houston, eval = FALSE}
p <- tx |>
  ggplot(aes(
    median,
    listings
  )) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
p
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "houston", echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Median sales price and numbers of listings."}
```
]

---

### Animating the Plot

Adding `ease_aes()` and `transition_*()` to the plot sets up the animation.

Calling the object invokes the `animate()` function,
which does all the heavy-lifting.

.pull-left[
```{r anim1, eval = FALSE, fig.retina=1}
library(gganimate)

anim <- p +
  transition_time(year) + #<<
  ease_aes() #<<

anim # same as animate(anim)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "anim1", echo = FALSE, fig.retina=1, dpi=144}
```
]


---

### Labeling

Use the special **glue** syntax inside `labs()` to add animated labels.

```{r fig.retina = 1, out.width = "50%"}
anim2 <- anim +
  labs(title = "Year: {frame_time}") #<<
anim2
```


---

### Fine-tuning

Use `animate()` directly for more control over the animation.

```{r fig.retina = 1, eval = FALSE}
animate(anim2, duration = 20, nframes = 150) #<<
```

```{r fig.retina = 1, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
animate(
  anim2,
  duration = 20,
  nframes = 150,
  res = 144,
  width = 4.8,
  height = 4.1,
  units = "in"
)
```

## Interactive Visualizations

Great for most datasets, particularly complicated datasets, but can
only really be used on webpages

Often useful in tandem with carefully designed static visualizations

.pull-left[
### plotly

Simple interactive visualizations can be achieved easily using [plotly](https://plotly.com/).

Two alternatives: 

- Call `plot_ly()` directly
- Use `ggplotly()` on a plot built in ggplot2

We focus on the second alternative.

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/plotly.png")
```
]

---

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5.2, eval = TRUE}
library(plotly)
p <- ggplot(msleep, aes(brainwt, sleep_total,
  color = vore,
  genus = genus,
  conservation = conservation
)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()
ggplotly(p) #<<
```

## Shiny

For more advanced interactive visualizations (beyond the scope of this workshop), 
have a look at [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).
